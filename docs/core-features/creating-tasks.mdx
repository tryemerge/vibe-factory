After creating a project, add tasks by clicking the **plus (+) icon** in the top right of your project kanban page, or by using the keyboard shortcut **`c`**. Creating a task adds it to your kanban board without automatically starting a coding agent.

## Using Templates

<Frame>

</Frame>

When adding a task, you can select from your saved templates:

1. Click the **Use a template** dropdown
2. Choose from available global or project templates
3. The template automatically populates the task title and description

<Note>
Templates save time by reusing common task structures. Learn more about creating templates in the [Task Templates](/configuration-customisation/creating-task-templates) guide.
</Note>

## Starting Your First Task Attempt

</Frame>

To activate a coding agent on your task, create a task attempt:

<Steps>
<Step title="Select your agent profile">
  Choose from available agents (e.g., CLAUDE_CODE, GEMINI, CODEX). Your default configuration from Settings is pre-selected.
</Step>

<Step title="Choose a variant">
  If your selected agent has variants, pick the appropriate one (e.g., DEFAULT, PLAN).
</Step>

<Step title="Set the base branch">
  Specify which branch the agent should work from. Your current branch is selected by default.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
Use **Create & Start** to add the task and immediately create a task attempt with your default settings in one action.
</Tip>

### What Happens During Execution

1. **Setup Scripts Run**: Any setup script defined in your project settings runs automatically
2. **Agent Execution**: The coding agent processes your task using the title and description  
3. **Real-time Monitoring**: Watch progress through streaming logs in the task interface
4. **Follow-up Questions**: Continue the conversation after execution to refine results

Most tasks only need a single attempt. You'll only need additional attempts if you want to restart from scratch with different settings.

<Note>
For detailed task management after execution, see [Task Details Full Screen Mode](/core-features/task-details-full-screen). To understand when you might need multiple attempts, see [Creating Task Attempts](/core-features/creating-task-attempts).
</Note>

## Creating Tasks via MCP Clients

<Warning>
This is not the typical method for creating tasks but can be valuable for bulk task creation or migrating from other systems.
</Warning>

Tasks can also be created programmatically using coding agents or MCP (Model Context Protocol) clients such as Claude Desktop or Raycast. This approach is particularly useful for:

- **Bulk task creation** based on existing data or project specifications
- **Migration from other systems** like Linear, GitHub Issues, or Jira
- **Automated task generation** from project plans or requirements documents

<Tip>
For detailed setup instructions and examples, see the [Vibe Kanban MCP Server](/integrations/vibe-kanban-mcp-server) documentation.
</Tip>

### Example MCP Task Creation

Once configured with an MCP client, you can create multiple tasks from a project description:

```
I need to implement user authentication with:
- Email/password registration
- Login with session management  
- Password reset functionality
- Email verification
- Protected route middleware

Please create individual tasks for each component.
```

The MCP client will automatically generate structured tasks in your Vibe Kanban project based on this description.

## Understanding Task Columns

Tasks begin in the "To do" column and move automatically based on their progress:

| Action | Column |
|--------|---------|
| Task created | To do |
| Task attempt started | In Progress |
| Task attempt completed (success or failure) | In Review |
| Task attempt merged | Done |
| PR merged on GitHub | Done |

<Info>
You can manually drag tasks between columns, but this won't trigger any functionality. Task movement is primarily driven by coding agent actions and GitHub integration (which polls every 60 seconds).
