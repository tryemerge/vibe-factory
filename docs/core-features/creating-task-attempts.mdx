A task attempt represents a single execution of a coding agent against a task. Most tasks only need one attempt, but you may need additional attempts for fresh restarts.

## When to Create New Task Attempts

Create a new task attempt when you want to:

- **Start from scratch** with a different approach after an unsuccessful attempt
- **Try a different coding agent** (e.g., switching from Claude to Codex)
- **Use a different agent profile or variant** for specialised behaviour
- **Work from a different base branch** to incorporate recent changes
- **Reset the conversation context** for a completely fresh start

<Tip>
Most users will only need one attempt per task. Only create additional attempts if the first approach didn't work as expected.
</Tip>

## Creating Additional Attempts

To create a new task attempt for an existing task:

<Steps>
<Step title="Navigate to the task">
  Open the task that needs a fresh attempt.
</Step>

<Step title="Click New Attempt">
  In the task interface, click the **New Attempt** button.
</Step>

<Step title="Configure the attempt">
  Choose your agent profile, variant, and base branch. These can be different from previous attempts.
</Step>

<Step title="Start execution">
  Click **Create Attempt** to begin a fresh execution with the new configuration.
</Step>
</Steps>

## Impact on Subtasks

<Warning>
Creating new task attempts affects subtasks. Subtasks are linked to specific task attempts, not tasks themselves.
</Warning>

When you create a new task attempt:

- **Existing subtasks** remain linked to their original parent attempt
- **New subtasks** created from the new attempt will use the new attempt's branch as their base
- This allows you to maintain different subtask workflows for different approaches

<Info>
For more details about how subtasks work with task attempts, see [Creating Subtasks](/core-features/subtasks).

## What Happens Next

After creating a task attempt:

1. **Setup scripts run** automatically (if configured in project settings)
2. **Agent executes** using your task title and description
3. **Real-time monitoring** shows progress through streaming logs
4. **Follow-up questions** can be asked to refine results

For detailed task management after execution, including development server controls, git operations, and monitoring features, see [Task Details Full Screen Mode](/core-features/task-details-full-screen).

## Git Worktrees

Vibe Kanban uses Git worktrees to create isolated environments for each task attempt. These environments are ephemeral and automatically cleaned up after execution completes.

<Info>
Worktrees ensure task attempts don't interfere with each other or your main working directory.
