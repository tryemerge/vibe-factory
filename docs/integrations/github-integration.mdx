Click **Connect GitHub Account** in General Settings to authenticate with GitHub using device flow authentication.

The authentication process is simple:
1. Click **Sign in with GitHub** 
2. Visit the provided GitHub URL in your browser
3. Enter the device code shown in the dialog
4. Authorize Vibe Kanban in your browser
5. Return to complete the setup

**Required Permissions**: Vibe Kanban needs access to your repositories (`repo`), basic profile info (`read:user`), and email address (`user:email`) for Git commits.

<Note>
If you encounter permission issues when creating pull requests, you'll be prompted to provide a Personal Access Token as a fallback authentication method.
