## See It In Action

### Pull Request Creation Dialog

</Frame>

When you're ready to create a PR, get a streamlined dialog that:
- Pre-fills title and description from your task details
- Lets you select the target branch (defaults to main/master)
- Validates that your branch is ready to go
- Provides direct links to your new pull request

### Smart Push/PR Button

<Frame>
<img src="/images/task-attempt-push-button.png" alt="Task attempt interface showing dynamic push/PR button" />
</Frame>

Each task attempt gets a smart button that adapts to your current state:
- **"Create PR"** when ready to share your work
- **"Push X commits"** when you have changes to upload  
- **"Push to PR"** when updating an existing pull request
- **"Pushed!"** confirmation after successful operations

<Note>
Each task attempt automatically creates an isolated git worktree, so you can work on multiple features simultaneously without conflicts.
</Note>

## Getting Started

### Connect Your GitHub Account

<Frame>
<img src="/images/github-connect-settings.png" alt="Settings page with Connect GitHub Account button" />
</Frame>

Click **Connect GitHub Account** in General Settings to authenticate with GitHub using device flow authentication.

<Frame>
<img src="/images/github-device-code.png" alt="GitHub device authentication dialog with verification code" />
</Frame>

The authentication process is simple:
1. Click **Sign in with GitHub** 
2. Visit the provided GitHub URL in your browser
3. Enter the device code shown in the dialog
4. Authorize Vibe Kanban in your browser
5. Return to complete the setup

**Required Permissions**: Vibe Kanban needs access to your repositories (`repo`), basic profile info (`read:user`), and email address (`user:email`) for Git commits.

<Note>
If you encounter permission issues when creating pull requests, you'll be prompted to provide a Personal Access Token as a fallback authentication method.
